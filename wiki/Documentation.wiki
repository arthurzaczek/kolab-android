= Introduction =

This is a short document of how to use Kolab Droid.

Before you start:

  * Don't use it if you rely on it
  * Have a Backup or use Test Data
  * Know how to recover your contacts and calendar events
  * Read the [VersionHistory]

= Troubleshooting =

Yeah, the first topic. This is a development version, troubles are expected!

  * Send issues
  * Share your experience and problems on the mailing list http://groups.google.com/group/kolab-connector-discuss
  * I you know adb: use it
  * Use [ErrorReporting]
  * Use [DiagnosticDump]
  * If you know Java and Eclipse: use it and send patches

= Details =

Kolab Droid is a sync provider. That means, that there is no icon to launch the App. Instead you can configure it under "Settings" -> "Accounts & sync".

The advantage of being a Sync Adapter is, that your contacts and calendar events are isolated from your other accounts (Google, Exchange, etc.). No data will be synced though the other Sync Accounts.

= Installation = 

You have 3 options:

  * Use the QR Code on the download page
  * Download the APK, save it on your SD Card and install it with an File Manager
  * Download the APK and use 'adb install KolabDroid-...apk'

Since version 0.6 upgrades should make no troubles.

= How to use it =


After installation goto "Settings" -> "Accounts & sync"

Hit the menu key and add a new Account. If the Account already exists, nothing will happen. We support only one Account for now.

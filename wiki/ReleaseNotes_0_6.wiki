#summary Release notes for Version 0.6

= Introduction =

At last, we are supporting Accounts & Synchronization now. That means, no more conflicts with other account types, namely google accounts.


= Installation or Upgrade =

Uninstall any previous installed Kolab Android Sync application.

If you are planning to sync every item with Kolab then your need to wipe (=delete) *all* your contacts and calendar events from your phone. Make sure to sync everything a last time with your old method.

Make sure you have all Contacts an Calendar Events already in your Kolab IMAP folders.


Install the new APK.

Then, under Accounts & Settings create a new Kolab Android Account. Setup IMAP and other settings.

Finally, enable the sync. Sync should start and create new Contacts and a new Calendar.

Sadly, we only support calendar sync on Android >= 2.2. Between 2.1 and 2.2 there are breaking changes we cannot bypass.

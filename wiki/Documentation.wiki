= Introduction =

This is a short document of how to use Kolab Droid.

Before you start:

  * I you know adb: use it

= Details =

Kolab Droid is a sync provider. That means, that there is no icon to launch the App. Instead you can configure it under "Settings" -> "Accounts & sync".

The advantage of being a Sync Adapter is, that your contacts and calendar events are isolated from your other accounts (Google, Exchange, etc.). No data will be synced though the other Sync Accounts.

= Installation = 

You have 3 options:

  * Use the QR Code on the download page
  * Download the APK, save it on your SD Card and install it with an File Manager
  * Download the APK and use 'adb install KolabDroid-...apk'

Since version 0.6 upgrades should make no troubles.

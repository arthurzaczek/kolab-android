#summary Overview of the synchronization algorithm
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

The actual synchronization algorithm is almost independent of the actual source and destination, and totally independent of the synchronized data items.

= Important Classes =

  * `CacheEntry`: holds all data to connect remote and local items and recognize changes in them
  * `SyncWorker`: the background worker thread that holds the main synchronization algorithm (`SyncWorker.sync()`)
  * `SyncHandler` interface: defines the necessary operations to be able to synchronize a local data store
  * `AbstractSyncHandler`: common code for all local data stores

=Auxiliary Classes=

  * `BaseWorker`: basic threading and status management
  * `StatusEntry`: log file data
  * `SyncContext`: "cursor" item for the currently synchronized item
  * `SyncException`: application specific exception
  * `SyncService`, `SyncServiceManager`: keep the synchronization running in the background

=Algorithm=

Based on the synchronization algorithm of [http://www.gargan.org/en/Mozilla_Extensions/SyncKolab/FAQ/ synckolab], the `SyncWorker` follows this plan (numbers reference comments and log messages in the source code):

  * (1) retrieve list of all imap message headers
  * for all messages:
    * (2) check message headers for changes
    * (5) fetch local cache entry
    * local entry found?
      * (6) no => save locally
      * (7) yes => compare data to figure out what happened
        * cur = local entry:
          * a: check for local changes and upload them
          * d: entry missing => delete on server
        * cur != local entry:
          * b: no local changes found: updating local item from server
          * c: local changes found: conflicting, updating local item from server
      * (8) remember message as processed
  * (9) for all unprocessed local items
    * a: skip already processed from server
    * b: found in local cache: deleting locally
    * c: not found in local cache: creating on server

= Introduction =

This is a short document of how to use Kolab Droid.

Before you start:

  * Don't use it if you rely on it
  * Have a Backup or use Test Data
  * Know how to recover your contacts and calendar events
  * Read the [VersionHistory]

= Troubleshooting =

Yeah, the first topic. This is a development version, troubles are expected!

  * Send issues
  * Share your experience and problems on the mailing list http://groups.google.com/group/kolab-connector-discuss
  * I you know adb: use it
  * Use [ErrorReporting]
  * Use [DiagnosticDump]
  * If you know Java and Eclipse: use it and send patches

= Details =

Kolab Droid is a sync provider. That means, that there is no icon to launch the App. Instead you can configure it under "Settings" -> "Accounts & sync".

The advantage of being a Sync Adapter is, that your contacts and calendar events are isolated from your other accounts (Google, Exchange, etc.). No data will be synced though the other Sync Accounts.

= Installation = 

You have 3 options:

  * Use the QR Code on the download page
  * Download the APK, save it on your SD Card and install it with an File Manager
  * Download the APK and use 'adb install KolabDroid-...apk'

Since version 0.6 upgrades should make no troubles.

= How to use it =


After installation goto "Settings" -> "Accounts & sync"

Hit the menu key and add a new Account. If the Account already exists, nothing will happen. We support only one Account for now.

Open this Account and hit "KolabDroid settings"

Edit your Settings: Enter IMAP host, username and password. Then hit "Test IMAP settings and update folder lists"

If it was successful you can select your contacts and calendar IMAP folders. At the end you can choose the minimum sync interval to save traffic and battery.

Hit the Back Key to save your changes.

Select the data sources you want to sync.

Sync should start now. If you hit "KolabDroid status" you can see the progress and logfile

Sync will be started, when android thinks it's time to sync. You can only configure the minimum interval.

We didn't find a documentation about this topic, but we observed that a sync is started at leased once a day and when something has changed on your phone.

Anyways, you can start a sync at any time by hitting the menu key and "Sync now"

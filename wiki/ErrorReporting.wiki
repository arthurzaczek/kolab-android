#summary Error Reporting with acra

= Error Reporting with acra =

We use acra (http://code.google.com/p/acra/) for error reporting now. Any handled and unhandled exception _can_ be send to a google doc spreadsheet. It's up to the user to send an error report or not.

Anyone can see that spreadsheet, there's nothing we want to hide:
